> The Score Discord bot is *currently* offline and not maintained anymore and it propably **won't** be hosted again in the future. So you cannot use it except you try to host it by yourself which the bot was not invented for.

## english

### Concept
Score records the activity of every user. That includes messages, reactions and how often he was helpful. For the last one other users can $thank you for helping them.

### Features
There are a global and a local leaderboard. Local means only users from the current Server.
Every user can see all of his data.
The bot prefix can individually be changed for a Server.
Admins can strike users as a consequence of misbehavior.

### [Invite the bot!](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=342017752434999306&scope=bot&permissions=27712)
When it's invited type *$help* to get an overview about the commands.
